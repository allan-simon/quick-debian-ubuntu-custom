quick-debian-ubuntu-custom
==========================

A set of scripts to quickly feel at home (zsh, vim, tools i need etc.), mainly for my personnal use, but feel free to fork it
I put it online because I got a lot of friends/students who keep asking me to sent them back my zsh/vim configuration, or which tools I'm using, so at least this way they will have one place where they can get an up to date version of them
It's all under a MIT licence
